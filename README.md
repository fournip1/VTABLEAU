A set of gimp plug-in that fits the following needs:
    * annotate over the first page of a given pdf
    * re-import the pdf even if it was modified and keep the annotations done previously
    * export the full document as a png
    * export the full document as a pdf with a timestamp
    * set-up my wacom tab with presets on the side buttons

The main purpose of these tools is to write Latex on a virtual board coupled wit a graphical tab to make annotations.
I was not satisifed with the existing pdf tools since they did not allow me to modify the latex document without loosing the annotations.
